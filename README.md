# PVR_Fraud_Detection
This project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect and classify buckets as either **Empty** or **Filled Popcorn Buckets** from a live webcam feed. The system integrates with an API to save detection details, including the detected image, timestamp.
